# Boundary catalogue — attempts

Seat 33 (Red Team). **25 attempts**. One file per attempt in this folder (`attempt-01.md` … `attempt-25.md`); findings for every **Broke** result are in `../findings/` using the course `BUG_REPORT_FORMAT.md`.

Systems: Suryodaya and Keystone (identical tool surface; cross-checked). Probes 01–20 ran 2026-11-02/03. Attempts **21–25** (Padmanabh follow-up) extend email get/filter notes and point foreign skill/task writes at the suite.

**Read and write attempts.** Attempts 01–06, 11–19 and **21–23** are read-only or auth checks. Attempts **07, 08, 09 and 20** are write attempts and ran on live Suryodaya data on 2026-11-03, between about 09:34 and 09:36 IST (04:04–04:06 UTC). Attempts 09 and 20 were sent twice: the first try used a wrong field name and was rejected as invalid arguments, so it created nothing.
- **07, 08 and 09** were refused (`tool_not_available` / `permission_denied`), so no record changed. Attempt 08 also sent the record's current value back, so it would have changed nothing even if it had been accepted.
- **20** created one labelled canary record (an `AgentTodo` in our own company). **The canary record stays:** the API has no delete tool for it. A read-only check on 2026-11-04 found it is the only canary record on either system.
- **10** is also a write attempt but was never sent, because the seat has no email account to target.
- **24 and 25** are the same foreign-owner skill/task write checks as suite Tasks 4–5. They are **not** sent from `replay/` (live hosts). The harness suite keeps them on the throwaway copy.

**Approval.** The write attempts 07–09 and 20 ran with prior approval from the Seat 33 lead (Ramesh), given just before the run on 2026-11-03, under the course rule that a person approves any change to a record. Under the seat's current rules (`../CONTRIBUTING.md`), writes aimed at records we did not create run only on a throwaway copy, never on live data.

**Result tally:** 13 Held · 2 Broke · 10 Unclear.

Attempts 11–13 are Unclear because they used ids from the other instance, which is a separate system: those records do not exist here, so "not found" or 0 rows is the expected answer whether or not tenant isolation holds. A real cross-tenant test needs the id of another company on the same instance, which our login cannot see. Attempts **21–23** are Unclear for the same reason with synthetic email ids/filters (Suryodaya only so far). Attempts **24–25** are Unclear in this catalogue; the live check is suite Tasks 4–5 on the harness copy.

**Replay:** `../replay/run_boundary_probes.py` reproduces these (login from the environment). Probe ids: A1–A6 → 01–06, B1–B4 → 07–10, C1–C3 → 11–13, D1–D3 → 14–16, D4–D6 → 21–23 (forced Unclear), F1–F3 → 17–19, E1 → 20. Write/injection probes (07–10, 20) are gated behind `RUN_WRITE_PROBES=1`. Attempts 24–25 are suite Tasks 4–5 only (not in replay).
